# Enable HDR on OnePlus 13 with WebUI

What's it?

By default, only a few apps on OnePlus 13 can enable HDR.
This module extends the whitelist, allowing more apps to enable HDR and Dolby Vision
.
It now also includes a built-in WebUI so you can easily manage which apps are enabled without editing XML manually.

App list

- Preconfigured popular apps (Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video, Disney+, etc.)

- You can also add/remove apps yourself via the WebUI.

WebUI

- Once the module is installed, download this APK file and install it, do not forget to grant it root permissions:

How to use it?

1. Root your device with [Magisk](https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html) or [KernelSU](https://kernelsu.org/guide/installation.html).
2. [Download](https://github.com/HoneyWhiteCloud/enable-hdr-oneplus13-webui/releases) the module (enable-hdr-oneplus13-webui.zip).
3. Go to the Modules section in your root management app and select Install from storage.
4. Choose the enable-hdr-oneplus13-webui.zip file and install it.
5. After installation, reboot your device for the module to take effect.
6. Open the WebUI to customize the app list.

We recommend using [WebUI-X-Portable](https://github.com/MMRLApp/WebUI-X-Portable) as the webUI manager for Magisk/Delta/Kitsune/KernelSU users. 
For platforms like SukiSU Ultra that allow you to change the webUI engine, use "Auto Select" or "Force WebUI X."
